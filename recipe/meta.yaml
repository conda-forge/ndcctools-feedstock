# Note we use the name "ndcctools" as there is already another project in

  summary: Tools for large scale distributed computing.
  description: |
    The Cooperative Computing Tools (cctools) are a collection of programs that
    enable large scale distributed computing on systems such as clusters,
    clouds, and grids. These tools are commonly used in fields of science and
    engineering that rely on large amounts of computing.
